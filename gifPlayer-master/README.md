gifPlayer
========

A simple jQuery based gif player script. 

Just need to add the class **playergif** to the desired **img** tag. The **src** property should point to the static image and the **data-swap** property should point to the animated gif.

```
<img class="playgif" data-swap="animated.gif" src="static.gif" />
```
